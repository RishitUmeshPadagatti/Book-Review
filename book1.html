        <div class="review">Consider this the first book I have read in my life, because I cannot remember the books I
            have read before. I read this book mainly because I gave a lecture on why this book (without having read it)
            is the best book,so let me read it at least once. I think the author hates schools and colleges because he
            speaks out against them throughout the book. To me, that's perfectly fine and I agree with him as well. He
            also mentions that he is not a "best-writing- author" but a "best-selling author". When I read that, I got
            goosebumps.<br><br>

            I think the book I read was the 2000 edition, and my highlighting marred the book a bit. There are many
            important things in this book and I wanted to photograph each paragraph (unfortunately, I do not have a
            Kindle to highlight them and easily access them later).<br><br>

            The book is about his experiences as a child when he had two "fathers": a genetic father who is poor but
            believes in education, and another father (his friend's father) who is rich and opposes the others' normal
            way of life.<br><br>


            It clearly distinguishes between assets and liabilities. There were a few diagrams showing cash flow and
            other things. He also focused on learning new things. He had once taken a course for $350 and made
            $2,000,000 using this method. He also suggested that we should know a little bit of everything. He also
            mentions how rich people avoid paying taxes and that it is almost impossible to tax an intelligent rich
            person. At the end of the book, he also mentions how to cover education costs of about $400,000 with only
            $7,000. Really interesting stuff!<br><br>

            This book is definitely recommended for beginners. It teaches us the basics of finance and also life. I
            would definitely read it again and give a more detailed review. I have a huge list of books I still want to
            read and this book is definitely the start.</div>
